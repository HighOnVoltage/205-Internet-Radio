The sketch was originally written using the **PlatformIO** IDE but will work just fine in the **Arduino IDE** too.

### For Arduino:

Create (or copy) the folder with the sketch and rename any .cpp files to .ino ones instead.

Place each library into a folder of its own in the usual place (in Ardiuno-land, there's a **libraries** folder within the sketches folder). Then the compiler will find the libraries when you do the "#include" statement.

Although I've copies a snapshot of the libraries here (because they're the ones I used and therefore know they work) you should always check for newer versions and see if they work too, as there may be fixes and enhancements.
